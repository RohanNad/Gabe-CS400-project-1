  Once upon a time, a boy named Leo was walking home from school. When he was about to reach his house, a huge flash blinded Leo and an earth trembling crash sent Leo to the ground. When he was finally able to regain his eyesight and stand up, he looked off into the field to his right, and saw what appeared to be a space ship the size of a house. Lights began to flash, and all of a sudden a door open. Out emerged a figure.  

  Leo could not believe his eyes; aliens, real aliens! Leo, with squinted eyes, barely makes out a figure walking towards him. The figure attempts to communicate 
  with Leo, but he is unable to comprehend a single bit of the jargon coming from the alien's large mouth. After multiple attempts at failed communication, a 
  second figure appears, who speaks in nearly perfect English to Leo. Leo has a million questions, but the alien, who mentions his name is BB, simply tells Leo
  to calm down and think clearly. Leo takes a deep breath and feverishly asks "Who are you? How do you speak English?", to which BB responds "We are outsiders
  from another planet far, far away. Your kind have not discovered us yet, and we know this because we have secretly been studying the mannerisms of your kind,
  especially me. It is how I specifically am able to communicate with you." Leo, confused, asks "What if anyone sees you?". BB slyly responds, "Let's see, shall
  we?"
